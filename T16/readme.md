Backend Implementation with Node.js and Express (JavaScript)
We'll create a simple Node.js server using the Express.js framework. This server will handle both the PDB proxying and the Gemini AI requests, incorporating the crucial CORS solution you referenced.

1. Setup Your Project
First, create a new directory for your backend (e.g., protein-backend), navigate into it, and initialize a Node.js project:

Bash

mkdir protein-backend
cd protein-backend
npm init -y
2. Install Dependencies
You'll need express for the web server, cors for handling CORS, axios for making HTTP requests (to RCSB PDB and Gemini), and dotenv for securely managing your Gemini API key.

Bash

npm install express cors axios dotenv
3. Create .env File (for your API Key)
In your protein-backend directory, create a file named .env. This file will store your Gemini API key securely. Never commit this file to version control (like Git)!

GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key.

How to Run Your Full Application
Save Files:
Save the server.js code in the protein-backend directory.
Save your .env file in the protein-backend directory.
Make sure your index.html (the frontend) is saved in a separate directory or the parent directory of protein-backend.
Start the Backend Server:
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the protein-backend directory: cd protein-backend

Run the server: node server.js

You should see Protein Explorer Backend running on http://localhost:8000. Keep this terminal window open.
Open the Frontend:
Open your index.html file in a web browser.
Important: For local development, it's highly recommended to use a development server (like VS Code's Live Server extension, or Python's http.server). If you just open file://path/to/index.html directly, some browsers might still impose stricter security rules on local files, even with the backend proxy.
If using Live Server: The frontend will likely run on http://127.0.0.1:5500 or http://localhost:5500. Ensure these are listed in allowedOrigins in your server.js.
Interact:
Load PDB: Enter a PDB ID (e.g., 1AKE, 6LU7) and click "Load PDB". Your frontend will request the PDB from your backend proxy, which then fetches it from RCSB.
Analyze Sequence: Paste a protein sequence and click "Analyze Sequence". This is purely client-side.
Ask Gemini AI: Type a question (e.g., "What is the function of 1AKE?", "What is an active site?") and click "Ask AI". Your frontend sends the question to your backend proxy, which then securely forwards it to the Gemini API.

bash 
npm install express cors axios dotenv

npm -init y   

node server.js
